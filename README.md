# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

This app is a simple weather tracker with a 5 day forecast using the OpenWeather API. The third-party API allows us to access the current weather and forecast thru making specific requests. Your challenge.

As a user you will be able to search for any city in the world and the current weather and 5 day forecast will generate on the main tabs.


## General Use Case

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
